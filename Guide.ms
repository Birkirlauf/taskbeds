## **Housekeeping Side of TaskBeds**

The housekeeping interface is designed for simplicity and speed, allowing staff to access, update, and complete tasks with minimal effort. It includes real-time task updates, room status management, and communication tools—all tailored for the needs of housekeeping teams.

### **Core Features for Housekeeping**

#### **1. Real-Time Task Board**
- **Kanban-Style Task Management**:
  - Tasks are displayed in columns based on status: **Pending**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**.
  - Tasks can be moved between columns via drag-and-drop or status updates.

- **Task Details**:
  - Each task card includes:
    - Task title (e.g., "Clean Room 305").
    - Room number and type (e.g., "Standard King").
    - Priority level (e.g., High, Normal, Low).
    - Special instructions (e.g., "Guest requested hypoallergenic bedding").
    - Estimated time to complete.

#### **2. Room Status Overview**
- **Interactive Room Map**:
  - Visual representation of all rooms with their current status:
    - **Vacant and Clean**: Ready for new guests.
    - **Occupied**: Guests are staying in the room.
    - **Needs Cleaning**: Requires housekeeping attention.
    - **Out of Service**: Maintenance or other issues.
  - Staff can update room statuses directly from the map view.

- **Quick Filters**:
  - Filter rooms by status, floor, or priority to focus on urgent tasks.

#### **3. Task Assignment**
- **Automated Assignments**:
  - Tasks are automatically assigned to staff based on availability, proximity, and workload.
  - Admins can reassign tasks manually if needed.

- **Personalized Task Lists**:
  - Each staff member sees only their assigned tasks, reducing confusion and overlap.

#### **4. Notifications and Updates**
- **Real-Time Alerts**:
  - Staff receive instant notifications for new tasks, priority changes, or updates to assigned tasks.
- **Progress Updates**:
  - Notifications are sent to managers when tasks are marked "In Progress" or "Completed."

#### **5. Reporting Issues**
- **Quick Issue Reporting**:
  - Staff can report maintenance or other issues directly from the task view or room map (e.g., "Broken shower in Room 402").
  - Issues are logged as new maintenance tasks.

#### **6. Daily Overview**
- **Shift Summary**:
  - Displays tasks completed, pending, and any flagged issues.
  - Encourages accountability and provides clarity at the end of each shift.

### **User Interface (Housekeeping Dashboard)**

#### **Main Components**
1. **Header**:
   - Displays the user's name, total tasks assigned, and progress for the day.

2. **Task Board**:
   - Kanban layout for task statuses.
   - Cards are color-coded by priority (e.g., red for High, green for Low).

3. **Room Map**:
   - Interactive floor plan showing room statuses.
   - Clickable rooms to update status or report issues.

4. **Quick Actions**:
   - Buttons for:
     - "Mark Room as Clean."

### **Workflow Example: Housekeeping Staff**
1. **View Assigned Tasks**:
   - Staff logs in and sees a personalized task list and room map.
2. **Start a Task**:
   - Selects a task from the board or map (e.g., "Clean Room 305").
   - Marks it as "In Progress."
3. **Complete the Task**:
   - After cleaning, updates the task to "Completed."
   - Room status automatically updates to "Vacant and Clean."
4. **Report Issues** (if needed):
   - Logs any maintenance issues encountered during cleaning.
   - The issue is added to the maintenance queue for follow-up.

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Frontend (Next.js)**
- **Dynamic Task Board**:
  - Uses drag-and-drop functionality with libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd`.
- **Room Map**:
  - Built with an interactive visualization library like D3.js or a custom React component.

#### **Backend (API Routes)**
- `GET /api/housekeeping/tasks`: Fetch all tasks assigned to the logged-in staff.
- `PATCH /api/housekeeping/tasks/:id`: Update task status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").
- `GET /api/rooms`: Fetch real-time room statuses.
- `PATCH /api/rooms/:id`: Update room status (e.g., "Needs Cleaning" to "Clean").
- `POST /api/issues`: Log maintenance issues.

#### **Database Schema (Example with Prisma)**
```javascript
model Task {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String
  status      String   @default("Pending") // Pending, In Progress, Completed
  priority    String   @default("Normal")  // High, Normal, Low
  roomId      Int
  assignedTo  Int      @relation(fields: [staffId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}

model Room {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  number      String
  type        String
  status      String   @default("Needs Cleaning") // Clean, Occupied, Needs Cleaning, Out of Service
  floor       Int
}
```
